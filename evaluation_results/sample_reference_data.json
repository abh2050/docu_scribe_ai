I've been having this persistent headache for the past three days.\n                Doctor: Can you describe the headache? Is it throbbing or constant?\n                Patient: It's more of a constant ache, especially behind my eyes.\n                Doctor: Any nausea or sensitivity to light?\n                Patient: Yes, bright lights make it worse.\n                Doctor: Have you taken any medication?\n                Patient: Just some ibuprofen, but it doesn't help much.\n                Doctor: Let me check your blood pressure. It's 150 over 95, which is elevated.\n                ",
