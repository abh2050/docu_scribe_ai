        "subjective": "SUBJECTIVE:\n\n- Chief Complaint: Persistent headache for the past three days.\n- History of Present Illness: Mrs. Johnson reports a constant headache, particularly behind her eyes. She describes the pain as an ache rather than a throbbing sensation. The headache is associated with photophobia, as she reports that bright lights exacerbate her symptoms. \n- Medications: She has attempted to manage the pain with ibuprofen, but reports minimal relief.\n- Other Symptoms/Concerns: Mrs. Johnson has not mentioned any other symptoms or concerns at this time.",
        "objective": "OBJECTIVE:\n\n- Vital Signs: Blood pressure is elevated at 150/95 mmHg.",
        "assessment": "ASSESSMENT:\n- The patient presents with a persistent, constant headache that has been ongoing for the past three days. The headache is particularly severe behind the eyes and is accompanied by photophobia. \n- The patient's blood pressure is elevated at 150/95 mmHg. \n- The patient's symptoms and elevated blood pressure suggest a possible diagnosis of Hypertensive Headache. \n- Differential diagnoses to consider include Migraine, given the photophobia, and Tension-Type Headache, due to the constant nature of the pain. However, the lack of response to ibuprofen and the presence of hypertension make these less likely. \n- Further investigation is needed to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes.",
        "plan": "PLAN:\n\n1. Medication:\n   - Start on Lisinopril 10 mg daily for hypertension. Monitor blood pressure at home and record readings.\n   - Continue ibuprofen for headache as needed, but not to exceed 1200 mg in a 24-hour period.\n\n2. Lifestyle modifications:\n   - Encourage a low-sodium diet and regular exercise to help manage hypertension.\n   - Recommend avoiding bright lights and other potential triggers for the headache.\n\n3. Follow-up:\n   - Schedule a follow-up appointment in 2 weeks to reassess blood pressure and headache symptoms.\n   - If headaches persist or worsen, or if new symptoms appear, patient should seek immediate medical attention.\n\n4. Referrals:\n   - If blood pressure remains elevated at the follow-up visit, consider referral to a cardiologist for further management.\n   - If headaches persist despite ibuprofen use, consider referral to a neurologist for further evaluation."
