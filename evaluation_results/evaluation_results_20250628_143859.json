She also notes increased sensitivity to bright lights. \n- Medications: The patient has been self-medicating with ibuprofen, which she reports as providing minimal relief.\n- Associated Symptoms: The patient reports no nausea.\n- Past Medical History: Not provided in this encounter.",
        "objective": "OBJECTIVE:\n\n- Blood Pressure: 150/95 mmHg (elevated).",
        "assessment": "ASSESSMENT:\n- The patient presents with a persistent, constant headache, particularly behind the eyes, that has been ongoing for the past three days. Accompanying symptoms include photophobia. \n- The headache is unresponsive to ibuprofen. \n- The patient's blood pressure is elevated at 150/95 mmHg. \n- The primary working diagnosis is Hypertensive Headache, given the elevated blood pressure and the persistent nature of the headache. \n- Differential diagnoses to consider include Migraine, given the photophobia, and Tension-type Headache, due to the constant nature of the pain. However, these are less likely given the elevated blood pressure. \n- The patient's symptoms and elevated blood pressure necessitate further evaluation and management to confirm the diagnosis and address the hypertension.",
        "plan": "PLAN:\n\n1. Medication: \n   - Start on Lisinopril 10mg daily for hypertension. Monitor for side effects such as dizziness or cough.\n   - Continue ibuprofen as needed for headache, but not to exceed 1200 mg per day. \n\n2. Lifestyle modifications:\n   - Recommend a low sodium diet and regular exercise to help manage hypertension.\n   - Recommend avoiding bright lights and wearing sunglasses if necessary to manage light sensitivity.\n\n3. Follow-up:\n   - Schedule a follow-up appointment in 2 weeks to reassess blood pressure and headache symptoms.\n   - If headache worsens or does not improve, or if new symptoms such as vision changes or severe nausea/vomiting occur, patient should seek immediate medical attention.\n\n4. Referrals:\n   - Consider referral to a neurologist if headaches persist despite treatment, or if they significantly interfere with daily activities. \n\n5. Monitoring:\n   - Patient should monitor blood pressure at home, if possible, and report any readings consistently above 140/90."
