        "subjective": "SUBJECTIVE:\n\n- Chief Complaint: Persistent headache for the past three days\n- History of Present Illness: Mrs. Johnson reports a constant headache, primarily located behind her eyes. She describes the pain as an ache rather than a throbbing sensation. The headache is accompanied by sensitivity to light, which exacerbates the pain. \n- Medications: The patient has attempted to manage the pain with ibuprofen, but reports minimal relief.\n- Additional Symptoms: No reported nausea.\n- Past Medical History: Not provided in this encounter.\n- Review of Systems: Not provided in this encounter.",
        "objective": "OBJECTIVE:\n\n- Blood Pressure: 150/95 mmHg, noted to be elevated.",
        "assessment": "ASSESSMENT:\n\n- The patient presents with a persistent, constant headache, predominantly located behind the eyes, of three days duration. Accompanying symptoms include photophobia. \n- The headache is refractory to ibuprofen. \n- The patient also has elevated blood pressure (150/95 mmHg). \n- The primary working diagnosis is Hypertensive Headache, given the elevated blood pressure and the persistent nature of the headache.\n- Differential diagnoses to consider include Migraine, given the photophobia, and Tension-type Headache, given the constant nature of the pain. However, these are less likely given the lack of response to ibuprofen and the presence of hypertension. \n- Further investigation is needed to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes.",
        "plan": "PLAN:\n\n1. Medications:\n   - Start antihypertensive medication to control high blood pressure. Consider starting with Lisinopril 10 mg daily.\n   - Continue ibuprofen as needed for headache. If it doesn't provide relief, consider switching to a different analgesic.\n\n2. Lifestyle modifications:\n   - Encourage a low-sodium diet and regular exercise to help manage hypertension.\n   - Recommend stress management techniques to potentially alleviate headache symptoms.\n\n3. Follow-up:\n   - Schedule a follow-up appointment in 2 weeks to monitor blood pressure and assess response to medication.\n   - If headaches persist or worsen, or if new symptoms develop, patient should seek immediate medical attention.\n\n4. Referrals:\n   - If blood pressure remains uncontrolled or headaches persist despite medication, consider referral to a specialist (cardiologist or neurologist, respectively)."
