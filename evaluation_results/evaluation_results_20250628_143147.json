She reports that her symptoms worsen with exposure to bright lights. She has attempted to manage the pain with ibuprofen, but reports minimal relief.\n- Past Medical History: Not provided in the conversation.\n- Medications: Over-the-counter ibuprofen for headache.\n- Allergies: Not provided in the conversation.\n- Review of Systems: Not provided in the conversation.",
        "objective": "OBJECTIVE:\n\n- Blood Pressure: 150/95 mmHg (elevated).",
        "assessment": "ASSESSMENT:\n- The patient presents with a persistent headache of three days duration, described as a constant ache, particularly behind the eyes. Accompanying symptoms include photophobia. \n- The headache is unresponsive to ibuprofen. \n- The patient's blood pressure is elevated at 150/95 mmHg. \n- The primary working diagnosis is Hypertensive Headache, given the elevated blood pressure and the persistent nature of the headache. \n- Differential diagnoses to consider include Migraine, given the photophobia, and Tension-Type Headache, given the constant nature of the pain. However, these are less likely given the lack of response to ibuprofen and the presence of hypertension. \n- Further investigations are needed to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes.",
        "plan": "PLAN:\n\n1. Medication Adjustment: \n   - Continue ibuprofen as needed for headache but add a prescription for Lisinopril 10mg daily to manage the elevated blood pressure. \n\n2. Lifestyle Modifications: \n   - Encourage the patient to reduce sodium intake, increase physical activity, and maintain a healthy weight to help manage blood pressure. \n\n3. Follow-up Instructions: \n   - Schedule a follow-up appointment in 2 weeks to reassess blood pressure and evaluate the effectiveness of the new medication. \n\n4. Monitoring: \n   - Instruct the patient to monitor blood pressure at home, if possible, and to keep a log of the readings. \n\n5. Referral: \n   - If headaches persist or worsen, consider referral to a neurologist for further evaluation. \n\n6. Other Interventions: \n   - Advise the patient to avoid bright lights and to rest in a dark, quiet room when experiencing a headache."
